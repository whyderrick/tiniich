        Thanks for being a friend! I built this site as  a gift to myself on my 30th
        birthday to reflect on who I am with the help of the people who know me.
        After you click the button below, you'll land on a short survey I've
        written. It should be about ten questions. By asking for ten answers from
        each of you, I'm hoping to have a solid reflection of who I've been over the
        past 30 years to inform who I'll strive to be in the next 30.

        I built this myself in far too little time. If you hit issues, want to
        recommend ways to improve it or want to use it yourself, drop me a text or
        an <a href="mailto:derrick@derrick.fyi">an email</a>.
